rem https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23256830/crossorigin-errors-when-loading-vtt-file
rem The problem was that I was loading my html file in browser directly from disk so when it tries to access the vtt file then browser gets a feeling of cross origin request and hence the error.
rem You can get rid of this error simply by hosting your web page inside a web server like IIS.
rem The moment you start fetching your html page like a website all the files like video, or *.vtt are all relative so issue of CORS gets resolved.
rem Configure the MIME type for your web application in IIS with below details:
rem File Name Extension: .vtt
rem MIME type: text/vtt
